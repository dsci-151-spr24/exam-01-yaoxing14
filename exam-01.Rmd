## Rules

1.  Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `exam-01.Rmd`.
    This file must include your code and write up for each task.
    Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline.
    Commit and push the Rmd and the md outputs of that file.

2.  This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people.
    You may use any online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use (directly or indirectly).
    You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam other than the Professor or TA for this course.
    You cannot ask direct questions on the internet, or consult with each other, not even for hypothetical questions.

3.  You have until **[DUE DATE]** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will **not** be accepted.
    Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

4.  Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach.
    You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these.
    I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers.
    See the first setup code chunk in your Rmd file to experiment with suppressing and revealing your code.

5.  Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well.
    For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4."

``` r
2 + 2
# 4
```

1.  You may only use `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` (and its dependencies) for this assignment. Your solutions may not use any other R packages.

## Academic Integrity Statement

*I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone other than the Professor or TA during this exam, and that all work is my own.*

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).
You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered.
Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

You are not allowed to post any questions on the public community repo or the public questions channel on Slack.
Any questions about the exam must be asked in person in office hours or on Slack via direct message to the Professor or the TAs.
For quickest response we recommend that you start a direct message with the Professor and all the TAs so that whoever gets to it first can respond to you.

## Grading and feedback

The total points for the questions add up to 90 points.
The remaining 10 points are allocated to code style, commit frequency and messages, overall organization, spelling, grammar, etc.
There is also an extra credit question that is worth 5 points.
You will receive feedback as an issue posted to your repository, and your grade will also be recorded on Sakai.

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `exam-01.Rmd`.
Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question.
Add code chunks as needed.
Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise.

Before completing, make sure to supress the code and look over your answers one more time.
If the narrative seems sparse or choppy, edit as needed.
Then, revert back to revealing your code.

Don't forget that you will need to configure your user name and email for Git to be able to push to your repository.

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need the `nycflights13` package for the data.
You will first need to install these packages and then load them.

## The data

The `nycflights13` package contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in 2013.
The main data is in the `flights` data frame, but there are additional data sets which may help understand what causes delays, specifically:

-   `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
-   `planes`: construction information about each plane
-   `airports`: airport names and locations
-   `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Questions

1.  **Question 1 (10 points)** - What are the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of fligts heading to each airport.
    
Narrative:
I think this analysis identifies the top 10 most common flight destinations from NYC airports in 2013 and the number of flights heading to each airport.

Approach:
I grouped the flight data by destination, counted the number of flights for each, and then sorted the results in descending order to get the top 10 destinations. I joined this data with the airport information to show the airport names alongside the flight counts.
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

top_destinations <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(num_flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_flights)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  select(name, num_flights)

print(top_destinations)

```

2.  **Question 2 (10 points)** - Which airlines have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of flights for each airline.
    In your narrative mention the names of the airlines as well.
    *Hint:* You can use the `airlines` dataset to look up the airline name based on `carrier` code.
Narrative:
This question examines the airlines that operated the most flights from NYC airports in 2013. The airlines with the highest flight counts include major players like American Airlines, Delta, and United.

Approach:
To solve this, I first grouped the flight data by the airline carrier code and counted the number of flights for each. After sorting the results in descending order, I joined this with the airlines dataset to map the carrier codes to full airline names. The resulting table shows the airlines and their respective flight counts.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

top_airlines <- flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(num_flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_flights)) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(name, num_flights)

print(top_airlines)

```

3.  **Question 3 (10 points)** - Consider only flights that have non-missing arrival delay information.
    Your answer should include the name of the carrier in addition to the carrier code and the values asked.

    a\.
    Which carrier had the highest mean arrival delay?

Narrative:
This part of the analysis focuses on identifying the airline with the highest average arrival delay, based on flights with available arrival delay data. The airline with the longest delay is highlighted.The last lowest one also proposed.

Approach:
I filtered the flights dataset to include only those with non-missing arrival delay information. Then, I grouped the data by carrier, calculated the mean arrival delay for each, and joined the result with the airlines dataset to display the full airline name. Finally, I sorted the airlines by the mean delay and identified the carrier with the highest average delay.The same method is used for lowest.
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

arrival_delays <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(name, carrier, mean_arr_delay)

highest_airline <- arrival_delays %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay)) %>%
  head(1)

print("Airline with the highest mean arrival delay:")
print(highest_airline)

```

    b\.
    Which carrier had the lowest mean arrival delay?
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

arrival_delays <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(name, carrier, mean_arr_delay)

lowest_airline <- arrival_delays %>%
  arrange(mean_arr_delay) %>%
  head(1)

print("Airline with the lowest mean arrival delay:")
print(lowest_airline)

```

4.  **Question 4 (10 points)** - What was the mean temperature at the origin airport on the day with the highest departure delay?
    Your answer should include the name of origin airport, the date with the highest departure delay, and the mean temperature on that day.
    
Narrative:
I think that question looks like the day with the highest departure delay and examines the mean temperature at the original airport on that day. The result shows both the airport name and the temperature.

Approach:
I filtered the flights dataset to find the day with the highest departure delay and calculated the mean temperature for that day at the origin airport using the weather dataset. I then added airport information to display the airport name along with the delay and temperature details.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

max_dep_delay <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  select(origin, year, month, day, dep_delay)

mean_temp <- weather %>%
  filter(origin == max_dep_delay$origin, 
         year == max_dep_delay$year, 
         month == max_dep_delay$month, 
         day == max_dep_delay$day) %>%
  summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE))

origin_airport <- airports %>%
  filter(faa == max_dep_delay$origin) %>%
  select(name)

print("Day with the highest departure delay and mean temperature at the origin:")
print(data.frame(origin_airport, max_dep_delay, mean_temp))

```

5.  **Question 5 (15 points)** - Consider breaking the day into four time intervals: 12:01am-6am, 6:01am-12pm, 12:01pm-6pm, 6:01pm-12am.

    a\.
    Calculate the proportion of flights that are delayed at departure at each of these time intervals.

    b\.
    Comment on how the likelihood of being delayed change throughout the day?
    in the morning, will be more punctual. in the night will be delay.
    
Narrative:
This analysis examines delayed flights at four time intervals throughout the day to understand variations in delays. 
Approach:
I created hourly intervals, calculated the proportion of delayed flights (defined as departures delayed by more than zero minutes), and summarized the results for each time period.
    
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

# Analysis for delay proportions based on time intervals
flights_delay_analysis <- flights %>%
  mutate(
    time_interval = case_when(
      hour >= 0 & hour < 6  ~ "12:01 AM - 6:00 AM",
      hour >= 6 & hour < 12 ~ "6:01 AM - 12:00 PM",
      hour >= 12 & hour < 18 ~ "12:01 PM - 6:00 PM",
      hour >= 18 & hour <= 23 ~ "6:01 PM - 12:00 AM"
    ),
    delayed = if_else(dep_delay > 0, 1, 0)  # Using if_else for type consistency
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay))  # Filter out rows with missing departure delay

# Calculating the proportions of delayed flights for each time interval
delay_proportions <- flights_delay_analysis %>%
  group_by(time_interval) %>%
  summarise(
    total_flights = n(),
    delayed_flights = sum(delayed),
    proportion_delayed = delayed_flights / total_flights
  ) %>%
  arrange(time_interval)  # Ensure intervals are in the correct order

# Print the results
print(delay_proportions)
```

6.  **Question 6 (15 points)** - Find the flight with the longest air time.

    a\.
    How long is this flight?

    b\.
    What city did it fly to?

    c\.
    How many seats does the plane that flew this flight have?

Narrative:
This analysis identifies the flight with the longest air time, its destination, and the number of seats on the operating plane. 
Approach:
To accomplish this, I filtered the flights dataset to exclude missing air time values and sorted the flights in descending order. After identifying the longest flight, I joined the airports dataset for the destination city and the planes dataset for the number of seats.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

longest_flight <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(air_time)) %>%  
  arrange(desc(air_time)) %>%
  slice(1)  


destination <- airports %>%
  filter(faa == longest_flight$dest) %>%
  select(name)


plane_info <- planes %>%
  filter(tailnum == longest_flight$tailnum) %>%
  select(seats)

longest_flight %>% select(origin, dest, air_time, tailnum)
destination
plane_info

```

7.  **Question 7 (15 pts)** - The `airports` data frame contains information on a large number of primarily American airports.
    These data include location information for these airports in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates.
    In this question we limit our focus to the [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States).
    Visualize and describe the distribution of the longitudes of airports in the Contiguous United States.
    What does this tell you about the geographical distribution of these airports?
    *Hint:* You will first need to limit your analysis to the Contiguous United States.
    [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) can help, but you're welcomed to use other resources as well.
    Make sure to cite whatever resource you use.

Narrative:
This analysis visualizes the distribution of airport longitudes in the Contiguous United States, highlighting geographic patterns related to population density and infrastructure.

Approach:
I filtered the airports dataset to include only those in the Contiguous U.S. and created a histogram to show the distribution of airport longitudes, revealing airport concentrations across the country.
    
The distribution of airports in the contiguous U.S. shows a clear disparity, with a higher density of airports in the east and fewer in the west. Compared to the east, the west has a smaller population and more mountainous terrain. This pattern reflects how geography, population distribution, and economic development influence airport infrastructure.
    
  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

contiguous_us_airports <- airports %>%
  filter(lat >= 24.5 & lat <= 49.5,  
         lon >= -124.8 & lon <= -66.9) 

ggplot(contiguous_us_airports, aes(x = lon)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Longitudes of Airports in the Contiguous U.S.",
       x = "Longitude",
       y = "Number of Airports") +
  theme_minimal()
```

8.  **Question 8 (15 pts)** - Recreate the plot included below using the `flights` data.
    Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be.
    *Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `arrival`, which is not included in the `flights` data frame.
    You will have to create `arrival` yourself, it is a categorical variable that is equal to `"ontime"` when `arr_delay <= 0` and `"delayed"` when `arr_delay > 0`.
The table compares the on-time performance of different airlines. The blue ones are flights with high on-time performance, while the yellow ones are delayed.

Narrative:
This plot shows the proportion of on-time and delayed flights for each airline, with blue bars for on-time flights and yellow bars for delayed ones.

Approach:
I categorized flights into "ontime" (arrival delay zero or negative) and "delayed" (positive arrival delay). Then, I grouped the data by carrier and arrival status, calculated the proportions, and visualized the results in a stacked bar chart.
    
    
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

flights <- flights %>%
  mutate(arrival = ifelse(arr_delay <= 0, "ontime", "delayed"))

carrier_arrival <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arrival)) %>% 
  group_by(carrier, arrival) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(carrier_arrival, aes(x = carrier, y = proportion, fill = arrival)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of On-Time and Delayed Flights by Carrier",
       x = "Carrier",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Arrival Status") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("ontime" = "steelblue", "delayed" = "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
